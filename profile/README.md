## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Using the **gqleX** code library, a developer can easily map out every element in a GraphQL document in relation to the node and context in which it operates, enabling them to:

Identify and select relevant nodes using **gqlXPath**, a syntax similar to Xpath in XML or JSONPath in JSON. The library also provides an equivalent code called SyntaxPath, designed to support automated code selection.
Take advantage of a set of transformer capabilities to add children or sibling nodes, duplicate nodes, remove children nodes, update node names and/or update field aliases.
